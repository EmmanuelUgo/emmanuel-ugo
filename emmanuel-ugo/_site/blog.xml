<p>Hello üëã</p>
<p>In this post, I go over my plans and ideas on a new project I am embarking on, <strong>A Whatsapp Chat Analyzer</strong>. It is a fun app where the user uploads their chat history and they are filled with fun fact information about their chats.</p>
<p>The number of features that would be in this app hasn‚Äôt been decided yet but with what I have currently, it should be a fun app. I did a little social experiment with friends and found out how interesting this project would be. Simply telling friends that they have sent <strong>X</strong> amount of messages over a particular period or they use a particular word all the time or some little fun fact can put a smile on their face. In turn, this project would solidify my understanding on Text Analytics and improve my R Shiny skills.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs go over some of the features of the app, shall we?</p>
<section id="features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="features">Features</h2>
<section id="chat-summary-feature" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chat-summary-feature">Chat Summary Feature</h3>
<p>This answers the following questions;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Total number of messages sent.</li>
<li>Total number of users.</li>
<li>Most active user (<em>by number of text sent)</em></li>
<li>User with the highest average length of text.</li>
<li>The least active user (<em>by number of text sent)</em>.</li>
<li>The user who uses a lot of Emojis üòÖ</li>
</ol>
<p>Plots that would be generated in here would include a plot of the (20) most active users by number of text sent and a plot of the top users with highest average text length.</p>
</section>
<section id="wordcloud-and-sentiment-analysis-feature" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wordcloud-and-sentiment-analysis-feature">Wordcloud and Sentiment Analysis Feature</h3>
<p>Here, I plan on grouping text into Happy and Sad sentiments and displaying them with wordclouds and also perform a sentiment trend analysis since there would be a date column.</p>
</section>
<section id="word-association-feature" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="word-association-feature">Word Association Feature</h3>
<p>This would group words together so we can understand how some words are connected. A network graph would be used to display the result.</p>
</section>
<section id="comparison-feature" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparison-feature">Comparison Feature</h3>
<p>This feature would drill down to a particular person or group of people and would highlight the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unique words for each user(s).</li>
<li>Activity Status: Average chat length, Number of messages sent, Ranking activity level by some time variables.</li>
<li>Wordcloud to display most used words.</li>
<li>Lexical Diversity.</li>
<li>Sentiments.</li>
<li>A feature to download these analysis.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="extras" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extras">Extras</h3>
<p>Another fun features to implement would be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a user enters a word, the app returns a plot of the people who has used that word the most and also a popularity trend and the total number of times that word was used.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these few ideas, the app should serve as a good data science project. I gave myself a deadline of 2 months to complete the app and I will try my best to beat that time.</p>
<p>I will be writing more blogs covering the entire process.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
